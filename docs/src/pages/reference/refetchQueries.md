The `refetchQueries` function can be used to refetch queries based on certain conditions.

Examples:

```js
import { refetchQueries } from 'react-query'

// refetch all queries:
await refetchQueries(environment)

// refetch all stale queries:
await refetchQueries(environment, { stale: true })

// refetch all active queries partially matching a query key:
await refetchQueries(environment, ['posts'], { active: true })

// refetch all active queries exactly matching a query key:
await refetchQueries(environment, ['posts', 1], { active: true, exact: true })
```

**Options**

- `environment: Environment`
- `queryKey?: QueryKey`: [Query Keys](../guides/query-keys)
- `filters?: QueryFilters`: [Query Filters](../guides/query-filters)
- `refetchOptions?: RefetchOptions`:
  - `throwOnError?: boolean`
    - When set to `true`, this method will throw if any of the query refetch tasks fail.

**Returns**

This function returns a promise that will resolve when all of the queries are done being refetched. By default, it **will not** throw an error if any of those queries refetches fail, but this can be configured by setting the `throwOnError` option to `true`
